# IMPLEMENT A CLIENT SERVER ARCHITECTURE USING MYSQL DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (DBMS).

### Client-Server refers to an architecture in which two or more computers are connected together over a network to send and receive requests between one another.
### In their communication, each machine has its own role: the machine sending requests is usually referred as “Client” and the machine responding (serving) is called “Server”

## To demonstrate a basic client-server using MySQL Relational Database Management System (RDBMS), follow the below instructions;

### 1. Create and configure two Linux-based virtual servers (EC2 instances in AWS). <img width="1280" alt="Screen Shot 2023-07-12 at 9 26 00 PM" src="https://github.com/bodebisi/Darey.io-Projects/assets/132711315/cbd49b68-a4e6-4a78-a9ba-532da322736f"> 

### In my previous projects, i describe how to launch and connect to an EC2 instance but if you haven't seen any of my projects, click this link to see how to launch it. https://youtu.be/xxKuB9kJoYM 
### I'm also dropping a link on how to connect your EC2 instance to your terminal or Virtual Machine. https://youtu.be/TxT6PNJts-s


### I'd also like to change the names of both servers on my terminal so i can differentiate them. so i type 
#### sudo hostname mysql-server
### I hit enter 
#### type bash
### hit enter again and the server name changes, I repeart the same process for the client server to also apply the change. see pic <img width="573" alt="Screen Shot 2023-07-12 at 9 35 47 PM" src="https://github.com/bodebisi/Darey.io-Projects/assets/132711315/4a154e6f-d0dc-4c9b-becc-3277a757791e">
