# IMPLEMENT A CLIENT SERVER ARCHITECTURE USING MYSQL DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (DBMS).

### Client-Server refers to an architecture in which two or more computers are connected together over a network to send and receive requests between one another.
### In their communication, each machine has its own role: the machine sending requests is usually referred as “Client” and the machine responding (serving) is called “Server”

## To demonstrate a basic client-server using MySQL Relational Database Management System (RDBMS), follow the below instructions;

### 1. Create and configure two Linux-based virtual servers (EC2 instances in AWS). In my previous projects, i describe how to launch and connect to an EC2 instance but if you haven't seen any of my projects, click this link to see how to launch it. https://youtu.be/xxKuB9kJoYM 
### I'm also dropping a link on how to connect your EC2 instance to your terminal or Virtual Machine. https://youtu.be/TxT6PNJts-s
